<h2 class="heading2">What is CSS?</h2>
<ol class="oder">
<li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
<li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
<li> <span class="linethr">CSS is not neccesary </span> <span class="highLight">CSS saves alot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li>
<li class="list4">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="heading2">CSS can be added in HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
<ul class="unorder">
<li>Inline - by using  the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
<li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
<li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS files.</li>
<li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="highLight">in this toturial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p class="para1">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
<p class="para1">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
<p class="para1">There is a wide range of selector available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
